        The Mini is a two-door compact city car that was produced by the British
        Motor Corporation (BMC) and its successors from 1959 until 2000. The
        original Mini is considered an icon of 1960s British popular
        culture.[11][12][13][14] Its space-saving transverse engine and
        front-wheel drive layout – allowing 80% of the area of the car's
        floorpan to be used for passengers and luggage – influenced a generation
        of car makers.[15] In 1999, the Mini was voted the second-most
        influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T, and ahead
        of the Citroën DS and Volkswagen Beetle.[16][17] The front-wheel-drive,
        transverse-engine layout of the Mini was copied for other "supermini"
        designs including the Honda N360 (1967), Nissan Cherry (1970), and Fiat
        127 (1971). The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs.
        This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by Sir Alec
        Issigonis. It was manufactured at the Longbridge plant in England
        located next to BMC's headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant
        at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland British Motor
        Corporation (Australia) factory in Sydney, Australia, and later also in
        Spain (Authi), Belgium, Italy (Innocenti) Chile, Malta, Portugal, South
        Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia (IMV).[18]
